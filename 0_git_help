## 
git has a concept of "remotes" - these are like easy nicknames for a repository, 
so you don't have to use its full URL every time you want to refer to another repository.

'origin' is just a remote like any other, but you see it very frequently since 
when you clone a repository for the first time, git clone will by default set up a remote called origin 
to refer to the URL that you cloned from.

If you do git remote -v that will show you all the remotes you have set up in 
your local repository, and the URLs that they refer to.
